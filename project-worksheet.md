## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to create a portofolio showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery. HTML will allow me to add and structure content. Colors, background images, fonts, and positioning will be modified using CSS. JavaScript and JQuery will be the metaphorical "bells and whistle" of the website. They'll add transitions and transformations, making my website more dynamic and eye-interactive.

## Wireframes

Include images of wireframe with a description of the specific wireframe.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Link](https://ibb.co/HDCZgbd)

 - Total Time: `25.5 hours`

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Layout
- Background Image
- About Me and Contents are filled, while Projects has placeholder projects/images.
- Responsive Design with Tablet and PC sizing

#### PostMVP 

- Extra Images
- Image Carousel

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 

| Layout              | H | 5hr   | hr |
| About Me            | H | 1.5hr | hr |
| Projects            | H | 1.5hr | hr |

| Grid Projects       | H | 1hr   | hr |
| Responsive Tablet   | M | 3hr   | hr |
| Responsive PC       | M | 5hr   | hr |

| Total | H | 22.5hrs| hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
